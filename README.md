# CS-350-Emerging-Systems-Architecture

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

I selected these two project artifacts as they were quite a good learning experience, one of them was just a simple thermostat, the other was sending encoded messages in morse code.

- What did you do particularly well?

I did particularly well on troubleshooting, I had every issue you could possibly have before things would go right. This in part was due to the differences in breadboards but also because my depth perception really isn't that great.

- Where could you improve?

I understood the overall logical flow of the problems, and I also grew to learn the differences in the breadboards, I would say the main bottleneck was actually not knowing that much about Python particularly. I tried using switch statements, brackets, semicolons, the whole works when it simply doesn't support that notation. One of the funniest cases was when I was debugging the morse code messages and they weren't right, the for loops were on the same level of indentation. 

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

This type of troubleshooting took a while, but it did teach me a lot and that understanding will really help me in the future when I will inevitably run into more issues. Learning the layout for the breadboard could help me particularly in Systems Architecture 2, and in general I really think understanding technology at a lower level is really transferable. I can understand that a 5V display shouldn't write to a 3.3V RaspberryPI and should instead be tied to ground. I could look into the specifics of why each different resistor was used. 

- How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

They were made maintainable by having the functions do set actions instead of just being a program read top-to-bottom, it makes updating functionality in one place update it throughout the rest of the code. It was really readable because if you didn't understand anything about the code, there were always comments that help point you in the right direction. Finally, the projects themselves could be adaptable for use cases like an in-door thermostat, or simply a fun way to learn mnorse code. But they aren't really meant for major adaptability as they have one set use case.
